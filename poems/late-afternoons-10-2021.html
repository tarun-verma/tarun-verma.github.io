        The beautiful golden days when you were soon to be dying <br>
        but could still enter into random conversations with strangers,<br>
        random but also deliberate, so impressions of the world <br>
        were still forming and changing you,<br>

        and the city was at its most radiant, uncrowded in summer<br>
        though by then everything was happening more slowly -<br>

        where did you go next, after those days,<br>
        where although you could not speak you were not lost?<br>
