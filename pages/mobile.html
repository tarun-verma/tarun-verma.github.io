            This website is more or less broken on mobile devices. It may be inconvenient, but if you're still interested, I'd recommend visiting on desktop instead.<br> <br>
            <b>I don't intend to make my website compatible with mobile devices anytime soon.</b> My limited knowledge of HTML/CSS aside, I also don't have the required time nor the necessary willpower to adapt it to modern web standards (especially for the smartphone). It will most likely continue to be a statically served HTML/CSS chaos, but the desktop side of things should be more readable.<br><br>
            At the moment, I'm not very interested in website generator engines like Jekyll, Hugo, etc. either. <br>
            I do apologise for the inconvenience!
