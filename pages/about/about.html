I intend this website to serve as my online personal space, or maybe a canvas of sorts - limited only by the extent of whatever I'm interested in at the moment (and whatever the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">w3c</a> allows). It may or may not be maintained or updated for a while. It may also see multiple structural changes as I see fit and as I experiment more with web markup, but I'll try to keep it readable on the desktop at least.

Things I'm interested in and may write/post about:
    <ul>
        <li>Fiction, particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterical_realism">hysterical realism/recherch√© postmodernism.</a></li>
        <li>Music - I play the bass guitar primarily, and spend some time exploring the production process as well.</li>
        <li>Something or the other related to computers, hardware, programming, security, internet culture, etc.</li>
    </ul>
The above list is obviously not exhaustive. I often find myself engaged in all sorts of things, some of that may also end up here, in some shape or form.
